        "content": "JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL\n\n(_Kept in shorthand._)\n\n\n_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\nrule.\n\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\nwaiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\ndon’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\n\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\ntravels with Mina.\n\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\nmust ask the Count all about them.)\n\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\nwhich they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\nvery excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_Mem._, get recipe\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\n\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\nself-assertion.\n\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.\n\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\nsaid, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\na letter:--\n\n     “My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\n\n“Your friend,\n\n“DRACULA.”"

        "content": "_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\ncomforting.\n\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\nvery hysterical way:\n\n“Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?” She was in such an excited\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\nshe asked again:\n\n“Do you know what day it is?” I answered that it was the fourth of May.\nShe shook her head as she said again:\n\n“Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?” On\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\n\n“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\nrosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\ncoach!"

        "content": "_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\ncalled “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\nstyle of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\n\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\n“word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\ncheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell,\n“stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\nsuperstitions)\n\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\nthe whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\nour journey.\n\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\ngreen hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road,\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\n\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\nbe right before us:--\n\n“Look! Isten szek!”--“God’s seat!”--and he crossed himself reverently.\n\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\nbut the driver would not hear of it. “No, no,” he said; “you must not\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then he added, with what he\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\napproving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters\nbefore you go to sleep.” The only stop he would make was a moment’s\npause to light his lamps.\n\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\nthought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said\nin German worse than my own:--\n\n“There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\nthe next day.” Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\nof themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\n\n“You are early to-night, my friend.” The man stammered in reply:--\n\n“The English Herr was in a hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--\n\n“That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.” As he\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger’s “Lenore”:--\n\n    “Denn die Todten reiten schnell”--\n    (“For the dead travel fast.”)\n\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “Give me the Herr’s\nluggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\nhanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\ncoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\nexcellent German:--\n\n“The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” I did not take\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\n\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\njump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\n\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\naround us I could watch the driver’s motions. He went rapidly to where\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\n\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\ntheir true import.\n\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\ncalèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\n\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\nsky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II"

        "content": "JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_\n\n\n_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\n\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\nof the dark openings.\n\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor’s clerk sent out to\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor’s\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\nwait the coming of the morning.\n\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.\n\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\n\n“Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!” He made no\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\n\n“Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\nhappiness you bring!” The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\n\n“Count Dracula?” He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\n\n“I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” As he was\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\nprotested but he insisted:--\n\n“Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.” He insisted on carrying\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\nflamed and flared.\n\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\ndoor:--\n\n“You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”\n\nThe light and warmth and the Count’s courteous welcome seemed to have\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\ntoilet, I went into the other room.\n\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\n\n“I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.”\n\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\npleasure.\n\n“I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\nyour instructions in all matters.”\n\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\nexperienced.\n\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\nphysiognomy.\n\nHis face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\n\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count’s eyes\ngleamed, and he said:--\n\n“Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!”\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\nadded:--\n\n“Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\nhunter.” Then he rose and said:--\n\n“But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\nso sleep well and dream well!” With a courteous bow, he opened for me\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\n\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\nsake of those dear to me!"

        "content": "_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\nwas written:--\n\n“I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.” I set to and\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when I had\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\nthe castle until I had asked the Count’s permission. There was\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\n\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\nLondon Directory, the “Red” and “Blue” books, Whitaker’s Almanac, the\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\nLaw List.\n\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\nnight’s rest. Then he went on:--\n\n“I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\nwill interest you. These companions”--and he laid his hand on some of\nthe books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.”\n\n“But, Count,” I said, “you know and speak English thoroughly!” He bowed\ngravely.\n\n“I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.”\n\n“Indeed,” I said, “you speak excellently.”\n\n“Not so,” he answered. “Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\nspeaking if he hear my words, ‘Ha, ha! a stranger!’ I have been so long\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\nimportant affairs in hand.”\n\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: “Yes, certainly,” and\nadded:--\n\n“You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” I said I was sure of\nthis, and then he went on:--\n\n“We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of\nwhat strange things there may be.”\n\nThis led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to\ntalk, if only for talking’s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.\nSometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most\nfrankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked\nhim of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue\nflames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a\ncertain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits\nare supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\nwhere treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he\nwent on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the\nWallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil\nin all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\npatriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\nsheltered in the friendly soil.”\n\n“But how,” said I, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\n\n“Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only\nappear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he\ncan help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he\nwould not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who\nmarked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight\neven for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to\nfind these places again?”\n\n“There you are right,” I said. “I know no more than the dead where even\nto look for them.” Then we drifted into other matters.\n\n“Come,” he said at last, “tell me of London and of the house which you\nhave procured for me.” With an apology for my remissness, I went into my\nown room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I\npassed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit\nin the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I\ncame in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I\nwent into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in\neverything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\nsurroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much\nmore than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\n\n“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I\nfall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend\nJonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!”\n\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\ninscribe here:--\n\n“At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\nrust.\n\n“The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\nperiods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.”\n\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\n\n“I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.” Somehow his words and his look\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.\n\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\nYorkshire coast.\n\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. “Aha!” he\nsaid; “still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\nam informed that your supper is ready.” He took my arm, and we went into\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\n\n“Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\nus,” and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\n\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\nwritten of this day."

        "content": "_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\nat once how I stand--or seem to.\n\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\nand heard the Count’s voice saying to me, “Good-morning.” I started, for\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count’s\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\n\n“Take care,” he said, “take care how you cut yourself. It is more\ndangerous than you think in this country.” Then seizing the shaving\nglass, he went on: “And this is the wretched thing that has done the\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man’s vanity. Away with it!” and\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\n\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\nthe forests.\n\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\nan available exit.\n\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III"

        "content": "JONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL--_continued_\n\n\nWhen I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.\nI rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of\nevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\nhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\nas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\nam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\none thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\nthe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\nhimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\nme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\nplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\nopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\nor else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\nshall need, all my brains to get through.\n\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\nthe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\nthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\nthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\nthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\ndining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\nmenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\nThis gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\nmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\nbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\nhand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\ncoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\ncrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\nthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\ncomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\nshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\nis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\na tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\ntime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\nmind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\nDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\nhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion."

        "content": "_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\nfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said “we,”\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put\ndown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\nfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\nthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\nhis race:--\n\n“We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,\nand of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the\nwere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the\ndesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?” He held up his arms. “Is it a\nwonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the\nMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his\nthousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when\nArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us\nhere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed\nthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were\nclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries\nwas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more\nthan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,\n‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ Who more gladly than we\nthroughout the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its\nwarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who\nwas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat\nthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that\nhis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the\nTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and\nagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,\nwhen he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had\nto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They\nsaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants\nwithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to\nconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the\nHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for\nour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the\nSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and\ntheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the\nHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.\nBlood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and\nthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.”\n\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the “Arabian Nights,” for\neverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet’s\nfather.)"

        "content": "_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\nobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\ndoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\nmatters I had been examining at Lincoln’s Inn. There was a certain\nmethod in the Count’s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\n\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\nwise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\none could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\nagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\nask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\nattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\nlocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\nsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\nchance mislead him, so he said:--\n\n“I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\nLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\nhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\nsought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\nresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\nserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\nhave some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\nseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\nI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\nDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\nease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” I answered that\ncertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\nagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\nhimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\nhim without further trouble.\n\n“But,” said he, “I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?”\n\n“Of course,” I replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”\n\n“Good!” he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\nagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\nwonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\nforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\nwonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\nspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--\n\n“Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\nHawkins, or to any other?” It was with some bitterness in my heart that\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\nsending letters to anybody.\n\n“Then write now, my young friend,” he said, laying a heavy hand on my\nshoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.”\n\n“Do you wish me to stay so long?” I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\nthought.\n\n“I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\nit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\nstinted. Is it not so?”\n\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins’s interest, not\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\ncould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\nin his own smooth, resistless way:--\n\n“I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\nother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\nfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\nhome to them. Is it not so?” As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\nnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\npost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\nwith the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\nas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\nhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\nnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\nto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\ndid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\nbook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\nsome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\nown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\nhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\nwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\nunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\nI could.\n\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\nbankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\nseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\nto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\nhand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\nthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\n\n“I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\nevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.” At the door he\nturned, and after a moment’s pause said:--\n\n“Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\nseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\nwarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\nhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then”--He finished his\nspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\nwashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\ndream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\nand mystery which seemed closing around me.\n\n_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\ndoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\nnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\n\nWhen he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\nsound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\ntowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\ninaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\nof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\nprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\nthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\nIt is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\nsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\nterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\nexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\nin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\nto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\nleaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\nbelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\nthe rooms, that the windows of the Count’s own room would look out. The\nwindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\nweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\nthe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\ncarefully out.\n\nWhat I saw was the Count’s head coming out from the window. I did not\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\nback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\nso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\nrepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\nwindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\n_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\nfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\nmoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\nbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\nstones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\nusing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\nspeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\n\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of...."

        "content": "_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\ndeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\nhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\nexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\ntaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\nexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\nstone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\npull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\ndoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count’s\nroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\nescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\nand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\nsmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\nthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\nhowever, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\nseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\nand found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\nfrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\nrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\nagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\nI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\nthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\nsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\nwindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\nside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\nwas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\nquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\nbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\nwest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\ncrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\ncomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\nglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\nwhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\nthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\nfound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\nwhich mere “modernity” cannot kill.\n\n_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\nam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.\nWhilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not\ngo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it\nis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I\ncan look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\npurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way\nlies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which\nhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--\n\n    “My tablets! quick, my tablets!\n    ’Tis meet that I put it down,” etc.,\n\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.\nThe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\n\nThe Count’s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon\nme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\n\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count’s warning came into my mind,\nbut I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,\nand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft\nmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\nwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for\nthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\nasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\nreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\nmorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\n\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\ndust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\ntheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\nno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\ntime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\nalmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\nfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\nlike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\nin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\nmoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\npearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\nabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\ndeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\nkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\nday it should meet Mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\nsilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\ncome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\ntingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\nThe fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\non. One said:--\n\n“Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\nbegin.” The other added:--\n\n“He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” I lay quiet,\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\nThe fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\nof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\n\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\nthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\ngloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\nand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\nlike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\non the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\nteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\nmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\npaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\nher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\nskin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that\nis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\nshivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\nand the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\nI closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\nheart.\n\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\nsaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\ngiant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\npassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\nthe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\nin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\nface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\nthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\nof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\nfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\nthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\nwolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\ncut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\n\n“How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\nI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\nhow you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” The fair girl,\nwith a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\n\n“You yourself never loved; you never love!” On this the other women\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\nof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\nand said in a soft whisper:--\n\n“Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\nkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\nto be done.”\n\n“Are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with a low laugh,\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\nnodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\nears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\nhalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\nbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\nwithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\n\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV"

I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by\nin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am\nrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and\nmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been\nevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or\nanother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one\nthing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed\nme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I\nam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not\nhave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this\nroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of\nsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who\nwere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood."

Last night the Count asked me in\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\nBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state\nof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I\nam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and\nthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to\nprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a\nchance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath\nwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained\nto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would\nensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much\nimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would\nbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my\nprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new\nsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked\nhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and\nthen said:--\n\n“The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June\n29.”\n\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!"

        "content": "_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to\nsend word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are\nencamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of\nthem in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though\nallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands\nof them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.\nThey attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and\ncall themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,\nsave superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany\ntongue.\n\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them\nposted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin\nacquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many\nsigns, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could\ntheir spoken language....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have written the letters. Mina’s is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.\nHawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,\nbut without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and\nfrighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the\nletters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the\nextent of my knowledge....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window\nwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The\nman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them\nin his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to\nread. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest\nvoice as he opened two letters:--\n\n“The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they\ncome, I shall, of course, take care. See!”--he must have looked at\nit--“one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other”--here\nhe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and\nthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“the\nother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is\nnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.” And he calmly held letter\nand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he\nwent on:--\n\n“The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is\nyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that\nunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?” He held\nout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\nenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later\nI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\n\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\nsleeping, he said:--\n\n“So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I\nmay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours\nto me; but you will sleep, I pray.” I passed to my room and went to bed,\nand, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms."

        "content": "_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\nand scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.\nWith joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\nleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty\nsheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the\nmain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.\n\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the Szgany came out,\nand seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they\nlaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\nentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.\nThe leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When\nthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. Shortly afterwards, I\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance."

        "content": "_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\nlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.\nThe Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of\nsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\nruthless villainy.\n\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\nsomething coming out of the Count’s window. I drew back and watched\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\nhad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,\nand in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will\nallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\npeople be attributed to me.\n\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which\nis even a criminal’s right and consolation.\n\nI thought I would watch for the Count’s return, and for a long time sat\ndoggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\nclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\nsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\nfully the aërial gambolling.\n\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far\nbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to\nring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to\nthe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to\nawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\nand my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\nwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\nmoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\nbeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\nshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\nsenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\nbecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\nthree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\nsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp\nwas burning brightly.\n\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\nCount’s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then\nthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a\nbeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\ncould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.\n\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\nthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning\nagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--\n\n“Monster, give me my child!”\n\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant\nemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see\nher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.\n\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be\nanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes\nhad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,\nthrough the wide entrance into the courtyard.\n\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\n\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\nshe was better dead.\n\nWhat shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful\nthing of night and gloom and fear?"

        "content": "_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the\nsun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me\nas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as\nif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must\ntake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last\nnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal\nseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the\nearth.\n\nLet me not think of it. Action!\n\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the\nCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that\nhe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!\nBut there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.\n\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone\nwhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his\nwindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk\nit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man’s death is not a\ncalf’s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me\nin my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have\ncome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I\nwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\naround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,\nand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I\ntook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down\nonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would\nnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty\nwell the direction and distance of the Count’s window, and made for it\nas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did\nnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed\nridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and\ntrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when\nI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked\naround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.\nThe room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\nseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\nstyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\nfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\nanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\ncorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\nHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\nthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\nless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,\nsome jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\n\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\nall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\nby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\nodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\ngrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\najar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently\nbeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\nsteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\nthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\nbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\nany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\nthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\nvaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\nmy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\nof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a\ndiscovery.\n\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a\npile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I\ncould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\nglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\ntheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\nmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\nand tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\nthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\nBy the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\nI thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\nthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\nthough unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\nleaving the Count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle\nwall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\nto think...."

        "content": "_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,\nlizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might\ndestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would\nhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared\nto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there\ntill I fell asleep.\n\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\nlook as he said:--\n\n“To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\nmeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the\nSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some\nSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall\nbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to\nBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\nDracula.” I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.\nSincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\nconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--\n\n“Why may I not go to-night?”\n\n“Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.”\n\n“But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.” He smiled,\nsuch a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick\nbehind his smoothness. He said:--\n\n“And your baggage?”\n\n“I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.”\n\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my\neyes, it seemed so real:--\n\n“You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is\nthat which rules our _boyars_: ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting\nguest.’ Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait\nin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that\nyou so suddenly desire it. Come!” With a stately gravity, he, with the\nlamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he\nstopped.\n\n“Hark!”\n\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great\norchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause\nof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\nthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it\nopen.\n\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\n\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder\nand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed\nfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that\nto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such\nallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door\ncontinued slowly to open, and only the Count’s body stood in the gap.\nSuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\ndoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There\nwas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and\nas a last chance I cried out:--\n\n“Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his\npowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged\nand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\n\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\nto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand\nto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that\nJudas in hell might be proud of.\n\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--\n\n“Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have\npatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!” There was a low,\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\n\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near\nthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\ndear!"

        "content": "_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\ndiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\nready.\n\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning\nhad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.\nWith a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen\nthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\nmassive bolts.\n\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at\nthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\ncasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\nCount.\n\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count’s\nroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\nevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count’s room. It was empty, but that\nwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\nremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\nstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\nenough where to find the monster I sought.\n\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\nwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\nplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\nI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\nsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\nbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\nand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\nand the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\never, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\ncorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\nburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\nsimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\nrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\nme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\nhorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\nkey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\non the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\nwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\nhe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\ncreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\nhelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\nto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\nbut I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\ncases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\nhateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\nupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\nparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\nmerely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\nhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\nthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\nown in the nethermost hell.\n\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\ncloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\ncracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\nspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count’s\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\nkey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\nhave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\nthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\ndying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\nrun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\nbut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\ndoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\nthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\nhopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\nround me more closely.\n\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\nwith their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\nbox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\n\nThe door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\n\nHark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\ndistance.\n\nI am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,\nand there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\n\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\nme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\n\nAnd then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!\n\nAt least God’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.\nGood-bye, all! Mina!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V"

The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.\nI am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together\nfreely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard\nlately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan’s studies, and I have\nbeen practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall\nbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I\ncan take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for\nhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He\nand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a\nstenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I\nshall keep a diary in the same way. I don’t mean one of those\ntwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a\nsort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not\nsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it\nanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try\nto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing\ndescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with\na little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears\nsaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little\nplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan\nfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I\nam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange\ncountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them\ntogether. There is the ten o’clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\n\n“Your loving\n\n“MINA.\n\n“Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for\na long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,\ncurly-haired man???”",

        "content": "_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\n\n“_17, Chatham Street_,\n\n“_Wednesday_.\n\n“My dearest Mina,--\n\n“I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I\nwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your\n_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing\nto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal\nto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the\ntall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the\nlast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.\nHolmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well\ntogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some\ntime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already\nengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well\noff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He\nis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under\nhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to\nsee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men\nI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I\ncan fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has\na curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to\nread one’s thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do\nyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not\na bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you\nhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological\nstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a\nbore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.\nThere, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other\nsince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and\nlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like\nto speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn’t you guess? I love him. I am blushing\nas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in\nwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that\ndoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire\nundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.\nI do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,\nor I should tear up the letter, and I don’t want to stop, for I _do_ so\nwant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all\nthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your\nprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\n\n“LUCY.\n\n“P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\n\n“L.”",

It was so\nnice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\n\n“My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.\nHere am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a\nproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.\nJust fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn’t it awful! I feel sorry,\nreally and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so\nhappy that I don’t know what to do with myself. And three proposals!\nBut, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be\ngetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured\nand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at\nleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and\nare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can\ndespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep\nit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You\nwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell\nArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think\nso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to\nbe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always\nquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just\nbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum\nman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool\noutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling\nhimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he\nalmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do\nwhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept\nplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to\nhelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I\ndid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute\nand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if\nI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,\nand then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one\nelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my\nconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman’s heart was\nfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to\ntell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he\nstood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever\nwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can’t\nhelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being\nproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at\nall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know\nloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to\nknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing\nquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so\nmiserable, though I am so happy.\n\n“_Evening._\n\n“Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left\noff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two\ncame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and\nhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he\nhas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise\nwith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that\nwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now\nwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I\ndon’t, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never\ntold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.\nMorris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl\nalone. No, he doesn’t, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I\nhelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,\nhe never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well\neducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me\nto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there\nwas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my\ndear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he\nhas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall\never speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never\nheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked\nas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was\nvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--\n\n“‘Miss Lucy, I know I ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your\nlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you\nwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won’t\nyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road\ntogether, driving in double harness?’\n\n“Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I\nwasn’t broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in\na light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so\non so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He\nreally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn’t help\nfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid\nflirt--though I couldn’t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\nnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\nheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall\nnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,\nbecause he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face\nwhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--\n\n“‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right\nthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow\nto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is\nI’ll never trouble you a hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will\nlet me, a very faithful friend.’\n\n“My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true\ngentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think\nthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very\nbadly. Why can’t they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want\nher, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say\nit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into\nMr. Morris’s brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--\n\n“‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he\neven loves me.’ I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a\nlight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I\nthink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--\n\n“‘That’s my brave girl. It’s better worth being late for a chance of\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don’t\ncry, my dear. If it’s for me, I’m a hard nut to crack; and I take it\nstanding up. If that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d\nbetter look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. Little girl,\nyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that’s rarer than a\nlover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I’m going to have a pretty\nlonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won’t you give me one kiss?\nIt’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you\nknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,\nmy dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spoken\nyet.’ That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and\nnoble, too, to a rival--wasn’t it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and\nkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down\ninto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--\n\n“‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these\nthings don’t make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet\nhonesty to me, and good-bye.’ He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,\nwent straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a\nquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like\nthat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would\nworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only\nI don’t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I\ncannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I\ndon’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.\n\n“Ever your loving\n\n“LUCY.\n\n“P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn’t tell you of number Three, need\nI? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his\ncoming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was\nkissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don’t know what I have done to\ndeserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not\nungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a\nlover, such a husband, and such a friend.\n\n“Good-bye.”",

Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty\nfeeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth\nthe doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was\nwork, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has\nafforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am\ndetermined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get\nnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.\n\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making\nmyself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing\nit there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep\nhim to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients\nas I would the mouth of hell.\n\n(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)\n_Omnia Romæ venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be\nanything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards\n_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--\n\nR. M. Renfield, ætat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;\nmorbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I\ncannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the\ndisturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly\ndangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution\nis as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of\non this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is\nbalanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed\npoint, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of\naccidents can balance it."

        "content": "MINA MURRAY’S JOURNAL\n\n\n_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\nwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\nharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\nview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\nbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\non either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\nsee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\nred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\npictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\nAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\n“Marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\nruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\na legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\nthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\ngraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\nWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\nstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\npart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\ndestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\nout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\nthem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\nsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\nbook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\nsitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and\ntalk.\n\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\nthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\nof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\nand its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\nnarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\n\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\nit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\nmournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\nlost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\nis coming this way....\n\nHe is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\nfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--\n\n“I wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.\nMind, I don’t say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn’t in\nmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,\nbut not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\nLeeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’\nout to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel’ who’d be\nbothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\nfool-talk.” I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\nthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\nthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\nwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--\n\n“I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn’t like\nto be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of ’em; an’, miss, I lack\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock.”\n\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from\nthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how\nmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that\na horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally\nhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went\nout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did\nnot go. They will be home by this."

        "content": "_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come\nand join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think\nmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit\nanything, and downfaces everybody. If he can’t out-argue them he bullies\nthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy\nwas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a\nbeautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did\nnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.\nShe is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her\non the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but\ngave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,\nand he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it\nand put it down:--\n\n“It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’\nnowt else. These bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles\nan’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women\na-belderin’. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an’ all grims an’ signs\nan’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’\nrailway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do\nsomethin’ that they don’t other incline to. It makes me ireful to think\no’ them. Why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper\nan’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the\ntombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them\nsteans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,\nis acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on\nthem, ‘Here lies the body’ or ‘Sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of\nthem, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t no bodies at all; an’\nthe memories of them bean’t cared a pinch of snuff about, much less\nsacred. Lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! My\ngog, but it’ll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they\ncome tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to\ndrag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them\ntrimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from\nlyin’ in the sea that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”\n\nI could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\n“showing off,” so I put in a word to keep him going:--\n\n“Oh, Mr. Swales, you can’t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not\nall wrong?”\n\n“Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make\nout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be\nlike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now\nlook you here; you come here a stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” I\nnodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\nunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.\nHe went on: “And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be\nhapped here, snod an’ snog?” I assented again. “Then that be just where\nthe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as\nold Dun’s ’bacca-box on Friday night.” He nudged one of his companions,\nand they all laughed. “And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at\nthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” I went over and\nread:--\n\n“Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of\nAndres, April, 1854, æt. 30.” When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--\n\n“Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast\nof Andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above”--he pointed\nnorthwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the\nsteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of\nthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in\nthe _Lively_ off Greenland in ’20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the\nsame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year\nlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned\nin the Gulf of Finland in ’50. Do ye think that all these men will have\nto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums\naboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’\njostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like a fight up on the ice\nin the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’\ntryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” This was\nevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his\ncronies joined in with gusto.\n\n“But,” I said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think\nthat will be really necessary?”\n\n“Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!”\n\n“To please their relatives, I suppose.”\n\n“To please their relatives, you suppose!” This he said with intense\nscorn. “How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote\nover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” He\npointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “Read the\nlies on that thruff-stean,” he said. The letters were upside down to me\nfrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over\nand read:--\n\n“Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a\nglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at\nKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly\nbeloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’\nReally, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke\nher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\n\n“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the\nsorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\nacrewk’d--a regular lamiter he was--an’ he hated her so that he\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on\nhis life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that\nthey had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it\nbrought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the\nrocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him\nsay masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious\nthat she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where\nshe was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his\nstick as he spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle\nwhen Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on\nhis hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”\n\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she\nsaid, rising up:--\n\n“Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot\nleave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a\nsuicide.”\n\n“That won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor Geordie gladsome to\nhave so trim a lass sittin’ on his lap. That won’t hurt ye. Why, I’ve\nsat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me\nno harm. Don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie\nthere either! It’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the\ntombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.\nThere’s the clock, an’ I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!” And off\nhe hobbled.\n\nLucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we\ntook hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and\ntheir coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I\nhaven’t heard from Jonathan for a whole month.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no\nletter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.\nThe clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the\ntown, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;\nthey run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my\nleft the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next\nthe abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind\nme, and there is a clatter of a donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.\nThe band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further\nalong the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.\nNeither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them\nboth. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he\nwere here."

He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,\nbut what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of\nanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd\nsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he\ndid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in\nsimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: “May I have\nthree days? I shall clear them away.” Of course, I said that would do. I\nmust watch him."

He looked\nvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time\nas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a\nhorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,\nhe caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger\nand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his\nmouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it\nwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and\ngave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must\nwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem\nin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always\njotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of\nfigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the\ntotals added in batches again, as though he were “focussing” some\naccount, as the auditors put it."

It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\nunconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your\nconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I\nmight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except\nthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has\nmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means\nof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by\ntempting them with his food."

When I came\nin he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,\nvery great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked\nhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and\nbearing:--\n\n“A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,\nand teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” I was not unprepared for this\nrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and\nvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows\nshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so\nI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a\ncat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--\n\n“Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should\nrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?” I shook\nmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but\nthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of\ndanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant\nkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him\nwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner\nbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\nimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner\nwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early."

He was spreading out his sugar,\nwhich he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his\nfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I\nlooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they\nwere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.\nThere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of\nblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if\nthere were anything odd about him during the day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. “My belief is,\ndoctor,” he said, “that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took\nand ate them raw!”\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make\neven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory\nproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to\ninvent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous\n(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he\ncan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He\ngave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then\nwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later\nsteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It\nmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at\nvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science\nin its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had\nI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of\neven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanderson’s physiology or Ferrier’s\nbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient\ncause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good\ncause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\nexceptional brain, congenitally?\n\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has\nclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\n\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,\nand that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great\nRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to\nprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be\nangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on\nhopeless and work. Work! work!\n\nIf I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a\ngood, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness."

And\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\ndifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I\nhad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but\nyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from\nhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed\nhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,\nand says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;\nI do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,\nalthough she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in\nher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided\nthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has\ngot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and\nalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over\nwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is\nnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy’s\nfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress\nhimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the\nautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is\nto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan\nand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to\nmake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only\nson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can\nleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\ncounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat\non the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it\nis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he\narrives."

If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should\nfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last\nletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable\nthan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and\nthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and\nlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is\nhidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except\nthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;\ngrey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the\ngrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea\nis tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey\nmist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and\nthere is a “brool” over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.\nDark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\nthe mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” The fishing-boats are\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into\nthe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is\nmaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that\nhe wants to talk....\n\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--\n\n“I want to say something to you, miss.” I could see he was not at ease,\nso I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak\nfully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--\n\n“I’m afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked\nthings I’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;\nbut I didn’t mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I’m gone. We\naud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t\naltogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;\nan’ that’s why I’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that I’d cheer up my\nown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a\nbit; only I don’t want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at\nhand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to\nexpect; and I’m so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin’ his\nscythe. Ye see, I can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at\nonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my\ndeary!”--for he saw that I was crying--“if he should come this very\nnight I’d not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a\nwaitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that\nwe can rightly depend on. But I’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my\ndeary, and comin’ quick. It may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and\nwonderin’. Maybe it’s in that wind out over the sea that’s bringin’ with\nit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!” he\ncried suddenly. “There’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont\nthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It’s in the\nair; I feel it comin’. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call\ncomes!” He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth\nmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes’ silence, he got\nup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled\noff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.\n\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\nkept looking at a strange ship.\n\n“I can’t make her out,” he said; “she’s a Russian, by the look of her;\nbut she’s knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn’t know her mind\na bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to\nrun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is\nsteered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;\nchanges about with every puff of wind. We’ll hear more of her before\nthis time to-morrow.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII"

        "content": "CUTTING FROM “THE DAILYGRAPH,” 8 AUGUST\n\n\n(_Pasted in Mina Murray’s Journal._)\n\nFrom a Correspondent.\n\n_Whitby_.\n\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\nAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\nbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\nRobin Hood’s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\nthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made\ntrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\n“tripping” both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\nafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\n“mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\nlanguage is ranked “No. 2: light breeze.” The coastguard on duty at once\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\nkept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\nmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\nbeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\nthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\nmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\nthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all\nsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\nsketches of the “Prelude to the Great Storm” will grace the R. A. and R.\nI. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and\nthere that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different\nclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\nThe wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\nwhich usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\nfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\nswell of the sea,\n\n    “As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”\n\nShortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\nband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\ngreat harmony of nature’s silence. A little after midnight came a\nstrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\ncarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\n\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\ngrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\nWhite-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\nthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\nof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\nforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\nor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\nto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\nfatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\nthe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\ndrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\nso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\nimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\na one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\ncleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\nlightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\nof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\nof the footsteps of the storm.\n\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\nabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\neach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\nsnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\na rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\nthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\nCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\ntried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\nthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\nOnce or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\nwith gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\nof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\npiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\njoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\nto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\n\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\nearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\nand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\nrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\nport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\nto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\nit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\nharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\ngreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\nvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\nspeed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,\nif it was only in hell.” Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\nany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\nlike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\nfor the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\nbooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\nthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\nmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\nbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\nof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\nthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\ngained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\nshudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\nawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\nfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\nall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\nschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\nthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\nstorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\nCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\n\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\n“top-hammer” came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\nthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\nif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\non the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\nhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\ntombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in\nthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\n\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\nall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\nout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\nside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\nfirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\nthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\nlight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\nwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\nonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\ncuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\nround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\ncorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\nWhen I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\nwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\ncourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\nto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\nwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.\n\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\nnot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\nwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\nthe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\nthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\nthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\nwas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\nstate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\nPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\nexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\npocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\nthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\nteeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\ncomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\nclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\nlaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\ncompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\nstatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\ndelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\nthat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\nhe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\nnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\nawait inquest.\n\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\ncrowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\nthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\nharbour in the storm."

        "content": "_Whitby_\n\n_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\n_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\nsmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of\n7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took\npossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\nacting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\npaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\nthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\nmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\nexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a “nine days’ wonder,” they\nare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\ncomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which\nlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\nS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\nanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;\nit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it\nwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still\nhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\nis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\nmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\ndead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. It had been fighting,\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\nand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\nexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for\nconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a\nrescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\nsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with\nsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that\nthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my\nstatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the\ndictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for\nme, time being short."

I dared not leave it, so shouted for the\nmate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He\nlooked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given\nway. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my\near, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_It_ is here; I know\nit, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,\nand ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind\nIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the\nair.” And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into\nspace. Then he went on: “But It is here, and I’ll find It. It is in the\nhold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I’ll unscrew them one by one and\nsee. You work the helm.” And, with a warning look and his finger on his\nlip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could\nnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest\nand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,\nraving mad, and it’s no use my trying to stop him. He can’t hurt those\nbig boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as\nharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and\nwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.\nThen, if I can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut\ndown sails and lie by, and signal for help....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate\nwould come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the\nhold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,\nstartled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he\ncame as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and\nhis face convulsed with fear. “Save me! save me!” he cried, and then\nlooked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in\na steady voice he said: “You had better come too, captain, before it is\ntoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me\nfrom Him, and it is all that is left!” Before I could say a word, or\nmove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately\nthrew himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was\nthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has\nfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these\nhorrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?"

The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is\nsimply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is\narranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk\nfor a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey\nsteps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners\nof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as\nwishing to follow him to the grave.\n\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much\nmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I\nbelieve, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so\nwill end this one more “mystery of the sea.”"

Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up\ntwice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and\nmanaged to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It\nis a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is\nthwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,\ndisappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her\nlife.\n\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see\nif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,\nand though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,\ngrim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that\ntopped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth\nof the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I\nfelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,\noh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully\nanxious about him.

        "content": "_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most\ntouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\nchurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst\nthe cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down\nagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.\nThe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on\nit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.\nShe was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that\nher dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:\nshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if\nthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional\ncause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our\nseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,\nfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of\nfear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor\ndear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so\nsweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other\npeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did\nnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men\nwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.\nThe dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw\nthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would\nnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few\nyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then\nharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a\nnoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs\nbristling out like a cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally\nthe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then\ntook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on\nthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the\nstone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did\nnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was\nin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,\nto comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to\ntouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly\nfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world\nwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The\nwhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead\nman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the\ntouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all\nafford material for her dreams.\n\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay and\nback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII"

Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\nand frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\nexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\nand give us a fresh start. We had a capital “severe tea” at Robin Hood’s\nBay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over\nthe seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have\nshocked the “New Woman” with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless\nthem! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,\nand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was\nreally tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.\nThe young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay\nfor supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I\nknow it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that\nsome day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new\nclass of curates, who don’t take supper, no matter how they may be\npressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and\nbreathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and\nlooks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her\nonly in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.\nSome of the “New Women” writers will some day start an idea that men and\nwomen should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or\naccepting. But I suppose the New Woman won’t condescend in future to\naccept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make\nof it, too! There’s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,\nbecause dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the\ncorner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be\nquite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him."

        "content": "_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.\nI am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an\nagonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....\nSuddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear\nupon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,\nso I could not see Lucy’s bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed\nwas empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The\ndoor was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her\nmother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some\nclothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it\nstruck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her\ndreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.\nDressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “Thank God,” I said\nto myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” I ran\ndownstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in\nall the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear\nchilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It\nwas not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people\nof the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that\nLucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what\nmight happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a\nbig, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the\nCrescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North\nTerrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At\nthe edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to\nthe East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don’t know which--of seeing Lucy\nin our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,\ndriving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of\nlight and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see\nnothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary’s Church and all\naround it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey\ncoming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as\na sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually\nvisible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for\nthere, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a\nhalf-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too\nquick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost\nimmediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind\nthe seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,\nwhether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another\nglance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the\nfish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East\nCliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced\nthat it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy’s condition. The\ntime and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath\ncame laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have\ngone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with\nlead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost\nto the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now\nclose enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There\nwas undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the\nhalf-reclining white figure. I called in fright, “Lucy! Lucy!” and\nsomething raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face\nand red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the\nentrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and\nthe seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in\nview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\nthat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\nof the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\nthing about.\n\nWhen I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips\nwere parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in\nlong, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\nbreath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the\ncollar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so\nthere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I\nflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\nfor I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\nunclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\nhave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\nthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\nand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\nbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I\nhad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began\nvery gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she\nbecame more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\noccasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other\nreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\ntill finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised\nto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.\nLucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must\nhave been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking\nunclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She\ntrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\nme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we\npassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She\nstopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.\nHowever, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\nwas a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\nmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no\none, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.\n\nFortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw\na man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\nus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\nthere are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in\nScotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I\nshould faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\nin case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our\nfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\nbed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I\nhesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\nmother’s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\nand thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\ninfallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\nso. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\nmy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping\nsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed\nnot to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not\nseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might\nhave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have\npinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\ntwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\nwas a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\nlaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it\ncannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the\nsun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave\nWoods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\ncliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for\nI could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had\nJonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening\nwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr\nand Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she\nhas been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door\nand secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any\ntrouble to-night."

It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\neffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,\nsilent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight\nflitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or\ntwice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,\nand flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back\nfrom the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.\nShe did not stir again all night."

Lucy seems\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\ndinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for\ndinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and\nstopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low\ndown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was\nthrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe\neverything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and\nsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--\n\n“His red eyes again! They are just the same.” It was such an odd\nexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\nat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on\nher face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but\nfollowed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,\nwhereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,\nfor it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like\nburning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red\nsunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary’s Church behind our\nseat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the\nrefraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I\ncalled Lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself\nwith a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she\nwas thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I\nsaid nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went\nearly to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;\nI walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet\nsadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then\nbright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the\nCrescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance\nup at our window, and saw Lucy’s head leaning out. I thought that\nperhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and\nwaved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,\nthe moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell\non the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against\nthe side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and\nby her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a\ngood-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,\nbut as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast\nasleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,\nas though to protect it from cold.\n\nI did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the\ndoor is locked and the window securely fastened.\n\nShe looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and\nthere is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I\nfear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it\nis."

I do not understand Lucy’s\nfading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys\nthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and\nshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping\nas if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at\nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open\nwindow. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I\ntried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to\nrestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,\npainful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the\nwindow she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may\nnot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat\njust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.\nThey are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the\nedges of them are faintly white.

Last night she slept well all\nnight, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already\nto her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she\nwere in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in\ngay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence\nseems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I\nneeded any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this\nvery seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with\nthe heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--\n\n“My poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.\nSwales would have told me that it was because I didn’t want to wake up\nGeordie.” As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she\nhad dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered\nlook came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her\nhabit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don’t wonder that he does. Then she\nwent on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to\nherself:--\n\n“I didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be\nhere in this spot--I don’t know why, for I was afraid of something--I\ndon’t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing\nthrough the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and\nI leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the\nwhole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as\nI went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and\ndark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very\nsweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking\ninto deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have\nheard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away\nfrom me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.\nI seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,\nand then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an\nearthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do\nit before I felt you.”\n\nThen she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I\nlistened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it\nbetter not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other\nsubjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the\nfresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more\nrosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very\nhappy evening together."

Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks,\nsuffering from a violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love,\nand to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter Hawkins,\nExeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his\ndelay, and that all of his work is completed. He will require some few\nweeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He\nwishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he\nwould like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall\nnot be wanting for help.\n\n“Believe me,\n\n“Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,\n\n“SISTER AGATHA.\n\n“P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something\nmore. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his\nwife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says\nour doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of\nwolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of\nwhat. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him\nof this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as\nhis do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we\nknew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one\ncould understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard\nwas told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station\nshouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that\nhe was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the\nway thither that the train reached.\n\n“Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his\nsweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no\ndoubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for\nsafety’s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,\nmany, happy years for you both.”",

        "content": "_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\n\n_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About\neight o’clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when\nsetting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest\nin him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the\nattendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was\nquite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he\nwould say was:--\n\n     “I don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the Master is at\n     hand.”\n\nThe attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has\nseized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with\nhomicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The\ncombination is a dreadful one. At nine o’clock I visited him myself. His\nattitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime\nself-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him\nas nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that\nhe himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man\nare too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves\naway! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created\nfrom human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,\nif men only knew!\n\nFor half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and\ngreater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict\nobservation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his\neyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it\nthe shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to\nknow so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his\nbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I\nwould find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to\nlead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite\nhis attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--\n\n“Bother them all! I don’t care a pin about them.”\n\n“What?” I said. “You don’t mean to tell me you don’t care about\nspiders?” (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling\nup with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--\n\n“The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;\nbut when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes\nthat are filled.”\n\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed\nall the time I remained with him.\n\nI am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and\nhow different things might have been. If I don’t sleep at once, chloral,\nthe modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let\nit grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of\nLucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,\nto-night shall be sleepless....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had\nlain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the\nnight-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield\nhad escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is\ntoo dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might\nwork out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.\nHe said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his\nbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His\nattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He\nran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once\nsent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.\nThe attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out\nof the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn’t get through\nthe window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,\nand, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The\nattendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt\nof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our\ngrounds from those of the deserted house.\n\nI ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend\nmight be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,\ndropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield’s figure just\ndisappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the\nfar side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\nironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some\none, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest\nI might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of\nbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping\nis upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not\ntake note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to\nhim--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him\nin. I heard him say:--\n\n“I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will\nreward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar\noff. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass\nme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?”\n\nHe _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes\neven when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a\nstartling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.\nHe is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I\nnever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I\nshall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and\nhis danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he\nmight have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any\nrate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat\nthat keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded\nroom. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are\nmore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.\n\nJust now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--\n\n“I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!”\n\nSo I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this\ndiary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX"

Well, my dear, I got to Hull\nall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I\nfeel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I\nknew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some\nnursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,\noh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out\nof his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his\nface has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not\nremember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At\nleast, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some\nterrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try\nto recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,\ntells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I\nwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,\nand say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the\nsecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear\nthem, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the\nnext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,\nand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved\nabout, added: ‘I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about\nanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,\nhave no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes\nto you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\ntreat of.’ I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my\npoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of\n_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a\ncause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his\nface while he sleeps. He is waking!...\n\n“When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something\nfrom the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.\nI saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to\nlet me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his\ntrouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent\nme over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.\nThen he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the\nnote-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--\n\n“‘Wilhelmina’--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--‘you know,\ndear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no\nsecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to\nthink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it\nwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain\nfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to\nknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ For, my\ndear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are\ncomplete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is\nthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me\nknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ He fell\nback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I\nhave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this\nafternoon, and am waiting her reply....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n“She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission\nchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon\nafter as Jonathan awakes....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n“Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very\nhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he\nsat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will’ firmly\nand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those\nwords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I\nshall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities\nI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the\nchaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it\nis the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’--left me alone\nwith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it\nup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon\nwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,\nand for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it\nto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would\nbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each\nother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake\nor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,\nLucy, it was the first time he took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it\nwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go\nthrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to\nhave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I\nshall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the\nyear.\n\n“Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love\nand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,\nand drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn\npledge between us....\n\n“Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because\nit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to\nme. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from\nthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,\nand with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that\nin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,\nplease Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of\nsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must\nnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be\n_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at\nonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan\nis waking--I must attend to my husband!\n\n“Your ever-loving\n\n“MINA HARKER.”",

There he is, calling to me.\nSo no more just at present from your loving\n\n“LUCY.\n\n“P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear.\n“P. P. S.--We are to be married on 28 September.”",

He has\nnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.\nFor the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one\nnight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to\nhimself: “Now I can wait; now I can wait.” The attendant came to tell\nme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the\nstrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone\nfrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might\nalmost say, “cringing”--softness. I was satisfied with his present\ncondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,\nbut finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange\nthing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,\ncoming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking\nfurtively at them:--\n\n“They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!”\n\nIt was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated\neven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I\ndo not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in\ncommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has\nhe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful\nto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the\noffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will\nonly say: “I don’t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,\nand I can wait; I can wait.”\n\nAfter a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet\nuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at\nlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted\nhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet\nfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It\nwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.\nHappy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He\nescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We\nshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they\nare required...."

At any rate, we have proved one\nthing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in\nfuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given\norders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,\nwhen once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise.

I sent word for the attendants to follow.\nAgain he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him\nin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me\nhe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he\nwould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing\nhappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew\ncalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught\nthe patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked\ninto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and\nghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one\nseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had\nsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and\npresently said:--\n\n“You needn’t tie me; I shall go quietly!” Without trouble we came back\nto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall\nnot forget this night...."

At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with\nher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw\nher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full\nopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship\nmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can\nbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to\ndraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have\ndone and propose doing.\n\n“I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,\nand in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew\nto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no\ndoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.\nWe lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we\ngot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\namongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with\nme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\nfor the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,\nhowever, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\nwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her\nhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\nmake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--\n\n“‘I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.’ I reminded her\nthat a doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\nanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that\nmatter in a word. ‘Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for\nmyself, but all for him!’ So I am quite free.\n\n“I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see\nthe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the\nquality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord\ngave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a\nslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured\na few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative\nanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\nitself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite\nsatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\ncause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\nmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\ntimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but\nregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she\nused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,\nand that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where\nMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not\nreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I\nhave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of\nAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the\nworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things\nwere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your\nrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to\nyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for\nher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal\nreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his\nwishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows\nwhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher\nand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;\nand he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron\nnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\nself-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the\nkindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the\nnoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\npractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I\ntell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in\nhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra\nto-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not\nalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.\n\n“Yours always,\n\n“JOHN SEWARD.”",

        "content": "_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._\n\n“_3 September._\n\n“My dear Art,--\n\n“Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and\nfound that, by Lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that\nwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of\nthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of\ncourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,\nbut says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you\ntrust to me in the matter, he said: ‘You must tell him all you think.\nTell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not\njesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ I asked\nwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had\ncome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his\nreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not\nbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his\nbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the\ntime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of\nour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for\n_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the\nsmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a\nstudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make\nit. In any case I am to have a letter.\n\n“Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first\nsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the\nghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was\nvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him\nfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard\nstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick\nlook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of\nall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite\ngeniality that I could see poor Lucy’s pretense of animation merge into\nreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation\ngently round to his visit, and suavely said:--\n\n“‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so\nmuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not\nsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a\nghastly pale. To them I say: “Pouf!”’ And he snapped his fingers at me\nand went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can\nhe’--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with\nwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a\nparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--‘know anything\nof a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them\nback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,\noh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the\nyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell\nthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many\nsorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to\nsmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all\nto ourselves.’ I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the\nprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but\nsaid: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional\ncause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has\nbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have\nasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,\nthat so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.\nAnd yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go\nback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if\nthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well\nis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me\ntoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.’\n\n“As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.\nAnd so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust\nyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my\ndear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who\nare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and\nyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to\ncome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from\nme.”",

        "content": "_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\n\n_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.\nHe had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just\nbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew\nthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a\nrun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so\nviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five\nminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank\ninto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The\nattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really\nappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the\nother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite\nunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was\nsome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and\nas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,\nwoe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show\nsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o’clock I looked in on\nhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He\nwas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture\nby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of\npadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to\nhis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to\nhumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the\nsugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a\nharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a\nbox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find\na spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any\nclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not\nrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of\nfar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--\n\n“All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do\nit for myself!” Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:\n“Doctor, won’t you be very good to me and let me have a little more\nsugar? I think it would be good for me.”\n\n“And the flies?” I said.\n\n“Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like\nit.” And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do\nnot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man\nas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,\nwhom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our\nown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As\nhis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in\nthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\nbeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\nand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\nwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone\nbuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart\nto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\nhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less\nfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\ninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\nrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\nquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to\nhold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight\nover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\nfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut\nthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised\nme, so I asked him: “Are you not going to keep flies any more?”\n\n“No,” said he; “I am sick of all that rubbish!” He certainly is a\nwonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his\nmind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue\nafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon\nand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at\nperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?\nWe shall see."

Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.\nThere is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.\nWestenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me\nprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told\nher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to\nstay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with\nmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a\nshock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy’s weak\ncondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with\ndifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall\ncome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you\ndo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for\nnews. In haste\n\n“Yours ever,\n\n“JOHN SEWARD.”",

        "content": "_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\n\n_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at\nLiverpool Street was:--\n\n“Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”\n\n“No,” I said. “I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I\nwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss\nWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.”\n\n“Right, my friend,” he said, “quite right! Better he not know as yet;\nperhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he\nshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal\nwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch\nas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God’s madmen,\ntoo--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why\nyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge\nin its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it\nand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” He\ntouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself\nthe same way. “I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall\nunfold to you.”\n\n“Why not now?” I asked. “It may do some good; we may arrive at some\ndecision.” He stopped and looked at me, and said:--\n\n“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has\nripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine\nhas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the\near and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,\nand say to you: ‘Look! he’s good corn; he will make good crop when the\ntime comes.’” I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply\nhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as\nhe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “The good husbandman tell\nyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\nthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\nthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,\nand Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\nthere’s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.” He broke\noff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very\ngravely:--\n\n“You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\nfull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and\nI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that\nknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.\nEven if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this\ncase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such\ninterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the\nbeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too\nsmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.\nHereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We\nlearn from failure, not from success!”\n\nWhen I described Lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely\nmore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a\nbag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia\nof our beneficial trade,” as he once called, in one of his lectures, the\nequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,\nMrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I\nexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained\nthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case\nwhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some\ncause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her\ndaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is\nsomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an\nenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that\nwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered\nselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice\nof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have\nknowledge of.\n\nI used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down\na rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness\nmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that\nI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were\nshown up to Lucy’s room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I\nwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the\nred seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of\nher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or\nhear. Van Helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged\ntill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not\nseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then\nVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The\ninstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to\nthe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and\nclosed the door. “My God!” he said; “this is dreadful. There is no time\nto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s\naction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is\nit you or me?”\n\n“I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.”\n\n“Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.”\n\nI went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at\nthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the\ndoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in\nan eager whisper:--\n\n“Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and\nhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\nmyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,\nsir, for coming.” When first the Professor’s eye had lit upon him he had\nbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\nhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\nseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to\nhim gravely as he held out his hand:--\n\n“Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is\nbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.” For he\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. “You are to\nhelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\nbest help.”\n\n“What can I do?” asked Arthur hoarsely. “Tell me, and I shall do it. My\nlife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\nher.” The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\n\n“My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!”\n\n“What shall I do?” There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril\nquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “Come!”\nhe said. “You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than\nme, better than my friend John.” Arthur looked bewildered, and the\nProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\n\n“Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have\nor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\nwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\nthe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is\nthe more young and strong than me”--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\nit hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,\nold or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not\nso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” Arthur turned to him\nand said:--\n\n“If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\nunderstand----”\n\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.\n\n“Good boy!” said Van Helsing. “In the not-so-far-off you will be happy\nthat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You\nshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\nmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\nher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!”\n\nWe all went up to Lucy’s room. Arthur by direction remained outside.\nLucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke\nto us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\nthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and\ncoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\n\n“Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good\nchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes.” She had made\nthe effort with success.\n\nIt astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked\nthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to\nflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\nits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was\nsatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\ncoat. Then he added: “You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\nover the table. Friend John, help to me!” So neither of us looked whilst\nhe bent over her.\n\nVan Helsing turning to me, said:\n\n“He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\ndefibrinate it.”\n\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the\noperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come\nback to poor Lucy’s cheeks, and through Arthur’s growing pallor the joy\nof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow\nanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\nwas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy’s system must\nhave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.\nBut the Professor’s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own\nheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: “Do not stir an instant.\nIt is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.” When all was over I\ncould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his\narm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\nman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\n\n“The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have\npresently.” And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\npillow to the patient’s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band\nwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\ndiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\nand showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I\ncould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing’s\nways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\nme, saying: “Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\nwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep\nmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\nhis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,\nthat you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways\nthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you\ncan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell\nher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\nhave done. Good-bye.”\n\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,\nbut her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\nbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.\nThe velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a\nwhisper:--\n\n“What do you make of that mark on her throat?”\n\n“What do you make of it?”\n\n“I have not examined it yet,” I answered, and then and there proceeded\nto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of\ndisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\ntrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\nwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\nthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed\nwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\nhave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.\n\n“Well?” said Van Helsing.\n\n“Well,” said I, “I can make nothing of it.” The Professor stood up. “I\nmust go back to Amsterdam to-night,” he said. “There are books and\nthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you\nmust not let your sight pass from her.”\n\n“Shall I have a nurse?” I asked.\n\n“We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\nshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all\nthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\npossible. And then we may begin.”\n\n“May begin?” I said. “What on earth do you mean?”\n\n“We shall see!” he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment\nlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held\nup:--\n\n“Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you\nshall not sleep easy hereafter!”"

        "content": "_Dr. Seward’s Diary--continued._\n\n_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself\noff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being\nfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,\nand she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the\nabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra\nthat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she\nalmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed\nstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made\npreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the\nnight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\nthe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\ngratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed\nsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\nand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort\nand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she\ndid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--\n\n“You do not want to go to sleep?”\n\n“No; I am afraid.”\n\n“Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.”\n\n“Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!”\n\n“A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?”\n\n“I don’t know; oh, I don’t know. And that is what is so terrible. All\nthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.”\n\n“But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and\nI can promise that nothing will happen.”\n\n“Ah, I can trust you!” I seized the opportunity, and said: “I promise\nyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.”\n\n“You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will\nsleep!” And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank\nback, asleep.\n\nAll night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on\nin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were\nslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a\npendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad\ndreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.\n\nIn the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result\nof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all\nday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my\nzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the\npast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst\nI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as\nit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the\nnight mail and would join me early in the morning."

For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my\nbrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral\nexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands\nwith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--\n\n“No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well\nagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who\nwill sit up with you.” I would not argue the point, but went and had my\nsupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I\nmade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than\nexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next\nher own, where a cozy fire was burning. “Now,” she said, “you must stay\nhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the\nsofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to\nbed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I\nshall call out, and you can come to me at once.” I could not but\nacquiesce, for I was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had I tried.\nSo, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,\nI lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything."

And together we went into the room.\n\nThe blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van\nHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.\n\nAs I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I\nheard the Professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a\ndeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and\nhis exclamation of horror, “Gott in Himmel!” needed no enforcement from\nhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his\niron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.\n\nThere on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly\nwhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums\nseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a\ncorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp\nin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit\nstood to him, and he put it down again softly. “Quick!” he said. “Bring\nthe brandy.” I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.\nHe wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and\nwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising\nsuspense said:--\n\n“It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is\nundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have\nto call on you yourself this time, friend John.” As he spoke, he was\ndipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I\nhad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no\npossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,\nwithout a moment’s delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did\nnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no\nmatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing\nheld up a warning finger. “Do not stir,” he said, “but I fear that with\ngrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much\ndanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection\nof morphia.” He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his\nintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge\nsubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride\nthat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid\ncheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to\nfeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.\n\nThe Professor watched me critically. “That will do,” he said. “Already?”\nI remonstrated. “You took a great deal more from Art.” To which he\nsmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--\n\n“He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her\nand for others; and the present will suffice.”\n\nWhen we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied\ndigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his\nleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by\nhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for\nmyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half\nwhispered:--\n\n“Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up\nunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and\nenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!”\n\nWhen I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--\n\n“You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and\nrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”\n\nI followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I\nhad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I\nfelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at\nwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over\nand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how\nshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to\nshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,\nsleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\nedges--tiny though they were.\n\nLucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and\nstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing\nhad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict\ninjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his\nvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.\n\nLucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything\nhad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother\ncame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but\nsaid to me gratefully:--\n\n“We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really\nmust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale\nyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you\ndo!” As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,\nfor her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted\ndrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned\nimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.\n\nVan Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:\n“Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I\nstay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and\nI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave\nreasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think\neven the most not-probable. Good-night.”\n\nIn the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of\nthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and\nwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing’s wish that either he or I should sit\nup, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign\ngentleman.” I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because\nI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy’s account, that\ntheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen\nsimilar instances of woman’s kindness. I got back here in time for a\nlate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting\nfor sleep. It is coming."

        "content": "_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van\nHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had\narrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it\nwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of\nwhite flowers.\n\n“These are for you, Miss Lucy,” he said.\n\n“For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!”\n\n“Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.” Here\nLucy made a wry face. “Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,\nthat bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but\nyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and\nhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the\nlotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters\nof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought\nfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late.”\n\nWhilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling\nthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and\nhalf-disgust:--\n\n“Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,\nthese flowers are only common garlic.”\n\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--\n\n“No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of\nothers if not for your own.” Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\nwell be, he went on more gently: “Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\nme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\ncommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the\nwreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so\ninquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;\nand obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait\nfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall\nhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,\nwhere my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.\nI had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”\n\nWe went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor’s\nactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia\nthat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\nin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round\nthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and\npresently I said:--\n\n“Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but\nthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”\n\n“Perhaps I am!” he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\nLucy was to wear round her neck.\n\nWe then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\nneck. The last words he said to her were:--\n\n“Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\nnot to-night open the window or the door.”\n\n“I promise,” said Lucy, “and thank you both a thousand times for all\nyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such\nfriends?”\n\nAs we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--\n\n“To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,\nmuch reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,\nand a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\nmore strong for my ‘spell’ which I have work. Ho! ho!”\n\nHe seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights\nbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must\nhave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but\nI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI"

        "content": "_Dr. Seward’s Diary._\n\n_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,\nup to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The\nProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.\n\nLet all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at\neight o’clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the\nfresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s\nannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,\nbut had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met\nMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early\nriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--\n\n“You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still\nasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I\nshould disturb her.” The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He\nrubbed his hands together, and said:--\n\n“Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working,” to\nwhich she answered:--\n\n“You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy’s state this\nmorning is due in part to me.”\n\n“How you do mean, ma’am?” asked the Professor.\n\n“Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into\nher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did\nnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those\nhorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually\na bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be\ntoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away\nand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be\npleased with her, I am sure.”\n\nShe moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As\nshe had spoken, I watched the Professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen\ngrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady\nwas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;\nhe actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into\nher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and\nforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.\n\nThen, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He\nraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat\nhis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,\nand putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs\nthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised\nhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “God! God!\nGod!” he said. “What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that\nwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the\npagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor\nmother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such\nthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we\nmust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are\nbeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!” Suddenly he\njumped to his feet. “Come,” he said, “come, we must see and act. Devils\nor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him\nall the same.” He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we\nwent up to Lucy’s room.\n\nOnce again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.\nThis time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same\nawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and\ninfinite pity.\n\n“As I expected,” he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which\nmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then\nbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another\noperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the\nnecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a\nwarning hand. “No!” he said. “To-day you must operate. I shall provide.\nYou are weakened already.” As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled\nup his shirt-sleeve.\n\nAgain the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to\nthe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I\nwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.\n\nPresently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must\nnot remove anything from Lucy’s room without consulting him; that the\nflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour\nwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case\nhimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would\nsend me word when to come.\n\nAfter another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and\nseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.\n\nWhat does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain."

I have a dim\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\nwits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\ncommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\nalone. Thank God for mother’s sake, and dear Arthur’s, and for all our\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\nthe window-panes."

Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called “business”\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--\n\n“Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You’ll excoose me\nrefoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\nI begins to arsk them questions.”\n\n“How do you mean, ask them questions?” I queried, wishful to get him\ninto a talkative humour.\n\n“’Ittin’ of them over the ’ead with a pole is one way; scratchin’ of\ntheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\nto their gals. I don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with a pole\nafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they’ve ’ad their\nsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\near-scratchin’. Mind you,” he added philosophically, “there’s a deal of\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here’s you a-comin’ and\narskin’ of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\nonly for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid I’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore I’d\nanswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I’d like you to\narsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence\ndid I tell yer to go to ’ell?”\n\n“You did.”\n\n“An’ when you said you’d report me for usin’ of obscene language that\nwas ’ittin’ me over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. I\nweren’t a-goin’ to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my ’owl\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor’ love yer ’art, now\nthat the old ’ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed\nme out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and I’ve lit hup, you may scratch\nmy ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even a growl out of me.\nDrive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere\nescaped wolf.”\n\n“Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\nhappened; and when I know the facts I’ll get you to say what you\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\nend.”\n\n“All right, guv’nor. This ’ere is about the ’ole story. That ’ere wolf\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\nNorway to Jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I’m more\nsurprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the\nplace. But, there, you can’t trust wolves no more nor women.”\n\n“Don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. “’E’s\ngot mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if he ain’t like a old wolf\n’isself! But there ain’t no ’arm in ’im.”\n\n“Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when I first\nhear my disturbance. I was makin’ up a litter in the monkey-house for a\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ I kem\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin’ like a mad thing at the\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn’t much people about that\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it. He\nhad a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\nfor it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. He ’ad white\nkid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\n‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’\n\n“‘Maybe it’s you,’ says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\n’isself. He didn’t git angry, as I ’oped he would, but he smiled a kind\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they\nwouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.\n\n“‘Ow yes, they would,’ says I, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘They always likes a\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a\nbagful.’\n\n“Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn’t put\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!\n\n“‘Tyke care,’ says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.’\n\n“‘Never mind,’ he says. ‘I’m used to ’em!’\n\n“‘Are you in the business yourself?’ I says, tyking off my ’at, for a\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\n\n“‘No,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I ’ave made pets of\nseveral.’ And with that he lifts his ’at as perlite as a lord, and walks\naway. Old Bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\nhere all began a-’owling. There warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.\nThere warn’t no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling\nstopped. Just before twelve o’clock I just took a look round afore\nturnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker’s\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\nthat’s all I know for certing.”\n\n“Did any one else see anything?”\n\n“One of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from a ’armony,\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. At\nleast, so he says, but I don’t give much for it myself, for if he did ’e\nnever said a word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\nnight-a-huntin’ of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein’\nanything. My own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”\n\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\nwolf?”\n\n“Well, sir,” he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, “I think I can;\nbut I don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”\n\n“Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\nexperience, can’t hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”\n\n“Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that ’ere\nwolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.”\n\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn’t cope in badinage\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\nso I said:--\n\n“Now, Mr. Bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me\nwhat you think will happen.”\n\n“Right y’are, sir,” he said briskly. “Ye’ll excoose me, I know, for\na-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\nas telling me to go on.”\n\n“Well, I never!” said the old lady.\n\n“My opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. The\ngard’ner wot didn’t remember said he was a-gallopin’ northward faster\nthan a horse could go; but I don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,\nwolves don’t gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\nin packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\nLor’ bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\n’im. This one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for\nhisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the Park a-’idin’ an’\na-shiverin’ of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin’ where he is to get\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can’t get food he’s\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher’s\nshop in time. If he doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with\na soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I\nshouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That’s\nall.”\n\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder’s face doubled its natural length\nwith surprise.\n\n“God bless me!” he said. “If there ain’t old Bersicker come back by\n’isself!”\n\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\n\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\npicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her\nconfidence in masquerade.\n\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--\n\n“There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;\ndidn’t I say it all along? Here’s his head all cut and full of broken\nglass. ’E’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. It’s a\nshyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.\nThis ’ere’s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.”\n\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the\nfatted calf, and went off to report.\n\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given\nto-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo."

Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\ninto the Superintendent’s study is almost unknown. Without an instant’s\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: “The blood is the life!\nThe blood is the life!”\n\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy’s\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and\nweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned\nme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without\nit."
